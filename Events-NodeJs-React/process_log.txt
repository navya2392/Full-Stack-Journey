AI Log Entry – Adding Followers, Popularity, and Genres Below Artist Title
Note: This change was implemented during the first iteration of the Artist tab. The final code looks slightly different, with added formatting and styling, but follows the same structure and logic.

Prompt:
“In the Artist tab, next to the artist profile picture, add the artist title in a larger font. Below the artist title, add Followers (with comma-separated numbers), Popularity (in %), and Genres should appear. 

Issue
Copilot correctly generated all three sections — Followers, Popularity, and Genres — but placed each inside separate <div> elements within a vertically spaced container. This caused them to stack vertically, while the requirement was to keep Followers and Popularity on the same line, and Genres below.

Before:

<div className="space-y-2">
  <div>Followers: ...</div>
  <div>Popularity: ...</div>
  <div>Genres: ...</div>
</div>


Fix
I manually wrapped the Followers and Popularity <div> elements inside a new parent <div> using Flexbox, leaving Genres as a separate line below:

<div className="space-y-1">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-6">
    <span>Followers: ...</span>
    <span>Popularity: ...</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <span>Genres: ...</span>
  </div>
</div>

The Flexbox container aligns Followers and Popularity horizontally with spacing between them, while the Genres line remains below for visual balance.

Explanation
Applying display: flex to the parent container changes the layout of its children from vertical to horizontal. By introducing this Flexbox wrapper, the Followers and Popularity sections now appear side-by-side instead of stacked. The design is cleaner and more readable, keeping related metrics together and the Genres line clearly separated below. This simple layout change meets the intended UI and remains responsive across screen sizes.
